Multirpg Script For Weechat

Usage (weechat script):

1. Fire up weechat
2. Connect to your server and log in to multirpg
3. Load the script
4. Unload the script
5. This should create a ~/.weechat/multirpg.conf file which you can now edit as appropriate
6. Re-Load the script
7. ...
8. Profit?

Alignment is a thing in this game. You might be able to set a default one in the config file if the script isnt loaded.
(I don't understand how weechat config files work)

Barely tested.

Usage (display server)

- Using virtualenv:

- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- execute with sudo ./venv/bin/python uhs.py
